# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of analysis
## The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.
### The purpose of this practice is for me to perform inner joins on multiple tables, combining them into a single table, and exporting the result as a CSV file. I want to find the answers by joining multiple tables into one using inner joins. This is an excellent analysis when I need to merge multiple tables into a single table.
# Results
### * The Retirement_Title table aims to merge data from the Employees and Titles tables into one, as both the date and name information are needed
### * Unique titles require the use of multiple tables, specifically the Employees and Retirement tables, to create one consolidated table. This is because the Retirement table does not include names and titles, so we've decided to add the Employee table. The focus will be on adding the name and title information to the final table
### * Retiring_Titles requires multiple tables, including the Unique table for titles and names, to be combined. The Employees table will also be added to provide necessary information for Retiring_Titles.
### * Mentorship needs multiple tables: the Employees table for names and dates, and the Dept_Emp table for filtering by years.
# Summary 
### This is a great practice for us, as it is both simple and educational. I think we could add a few more tables related to gender, age, or height to make the exercise more fun and complex.
